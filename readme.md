# Readme

This is a project boilerplate mostly catered to my needs and those of developers around me.

This setup can do quite a few things;

* It transpiles async/await
* PostCSS works (CSS imports, custom variables, nesting, remove comments on build)
* UnCSS removes all unused CSS when building
* Copies images, fonts, CSS, JS and html over
* Has HTMLprocessor for whatever you need it for
* Browsersync for live preview & reloading

Basically, this is awesome.

## Getting started

`yarn install`

`yarn run start` for developing

`yarn run build` for building, with all optimizations!
